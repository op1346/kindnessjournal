        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The Kindness Journal started off in 2012 with a friend of mine when we were in high school. At the time, I was going through a rough time and needed to know that there were good things in the world and kind people. We started a physical journal where we wrote done the kind things we or others had done. I created this website in hopes that we could spread this kindness globally. I hope it brightens up your day!</p>
